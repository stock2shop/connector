# OS - CONNECTOR

## Overview

This folder contains the files which make up a connector for a hypothetical system
which writes and reads data to the OS. Instead of sending data to an API it uses the 
file system to persist data.

## Storage

JSON data created by this channel is stored in the [data directory](data).
